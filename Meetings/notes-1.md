**Time:** 11:30AM-12:30AM

**Location:** ME Conference Room, EP

**Attendees:** Kennedy Caisley, Ryan Donahue, Dr. Daniel Robertson, Ankit Gupta, Taylor Spence

* Project History
  * Device is 2 years old
  * Is actually three devices
  * Schematics and Code will be shared
  * Arduino runs sensors and captures data, sends it to the Rpi via I2c
  * RPI saved data and ran the screen
  * $500 of parts (not including force sensor) plus hundreds in labor
* Screen
  * Resistive vs capacitive undecided
  * Screen must be readable  in sunlight
  * LCD screen would be a stretch goal
  * Plants must not press buttons
  * Waterproof
  * Responsive
  * Wide viewing angle
* Peripherals
  * Custom barcode scanner: Bluetooth is best
  * GPS: Time of day/date, location
  * Temp and humidity sensor
  * Two Load Cells
  * Motor Controller for linear actuator for board 2
  * Rotational Encoder  for board 3
* Hardware/Software
  * Software needs to recognize what peripherals are installed
  * Need fast processing and efficient software to make the screen fast
  * Reduce noise in signal measurement
  * a calibration routine
    * Load cell can drift over time, we need 
    * Put known weights, create chart mapping force to voltage, change interpretation routine
* Team organization
  * Team name is “Team Crop Top”
  * Doodle poll for meeting planning
  * Google docs for project logging
  * Slack for project management
