DC bias on pin 2 and 3
Passive antenna is connected to Pin 3, sensitive RF circuit, requires impedance matching and track length
Patch antennas and helix antennas have the best performance
patch antenna should be at least 18x18 mm and should be over at least a 50x50mm ground plane
Antenna must match 50 ohms impedance of the receiver
No components should be place close to the patch antenna
Minimum disdance between the antenna dn the housing of the devie
No signal lines should pass under or near the antenna
Inductor to ground for >2dbic antenna


Notes from 11/9/2018:
Chip antennas are cheapest, and multidirectional. They will work best for application. Ceramic patch antennas, while better performing, are directional, larger, and cost more. (They also look less cool.)
