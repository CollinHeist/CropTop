# Project CropTop

After more than a century of research, wind induced crop failure (breaking of plants) remains an unsolved
problem of international scope. Conservative estimates predict wind induced crop failure results in economic
losses on the order of tens of billions of dollars annually. Researchers from the University of Idaho, Brigham
Young University and New York University have recently created a patented tool that will allow plant breeders
to develop greatly improved crop varieties that are highly resistant to wind induced stalk failure. The device
employs load cells, rotational sensors, accelerometers and a standalone computing center. It is able to predict
plant strength without permanently damaging the plant, thereby enabling temporal analysis of plant strength.
