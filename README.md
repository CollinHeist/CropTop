# CropTop

CropTop is a small-form data aquisition platform being developed by [Kennedy Caisley](https://github.com/kcaisley) and [Ryan Donahue](https://github.com/ryand323), two undergraduate electrical engineering students at the University of Idaho. It is designed to support the cereal grain crop strength research being conducted by [Dr. Daniel Roberston](https://www.uidaho.edu/engr/departments/me/our-people/faculty/daniel-robertson) in the UI Department of Mechanical Engineering.

Croptop is based around a 32 bit PIC32MX795F512L microcontroller and includes the following peripherals onboard:
* 12 bit temperature/humidity sensor
* 3-axis accelerometer
* ΔΣ 24 bit 1kSPS ADC
* GNSS reciever
* USB 2.0 OTG interface
* 5A DC motor controller
* TFT LCD controller
* Resistive touch controller
* Rotary encoder interface
* Linear ecoder interface
* 1GB NAND flash
* User programmable push buttons
* User programmable LEDs
* 14 additional GPIO
