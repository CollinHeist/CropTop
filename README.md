Ryan and I recieved our capstone project assignment today, entitled "*Product Design for Manufacture and Reliability*". Basic info on the project scope can be found [here](https://github.com/kcaisley/CropTop/blob/master/Documentation/project-statement.pdf). We are the only two members on the team. Ryan and I decided how the various project roles would be divided amongst us. I will be responsible for scheduling, planning, and running meetings. Ryan will be largely responsible for the project budget and timeline. Many of the other tasks, including client communication, assembling the portfolio, and technical design will be shared. A more defined division of labor will develop as the semester progresses.

To do:
- [x] Pick a team name
- [x] Plan for first meeting
- [x] Write team contract
- [x] Decide on collaboration tools

I sent out a Doodle poll to find a time this week when Ankit, Taylor, and Dr. Robertson could meet with Ryan and I. The meeting will be this Friday from 11:30AM-12:30PM. The agenda can be found [here](https://github.com/kcaisley/CropTop/blob/master/Meetings/notes-1.md).

Ryan and I have come up with the name *Team Crop Top*. We will check to make sure Dr. Robertson approves this Friday. The team contract has also been drafted and is stored on Ryan's OneDrive. For collaboration tools we will be using Slack for messaging, Doodle polls for meeting planning, and Google Docs and Microsoft OneDrive for file storage.

Thinking back to the team meeting, it seems the order of priotiries are:
Project goals, in order of importance

I have been thinking a lot about the GUI display, I posted on reddit.

The reddit post has blown up, the full post can be found here, but the take aways are.

I attened a workshop today on git, and have decided to port everything to github, for version control.

Ryan and I also picked up the prototype device and I started to pick it apart. Here is a picture of the current prototype.

I plan to do a more thorough breakdown of the device in the coming days, also looking through the
