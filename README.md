Ryan and I recieved our capstone project assignment today, entitled "*Product Design for Manufacture and Reliability*". Basic info on the project scope can be found [here](https://github.com/kcaisley/CropTop/blob/master/Documentation/project-statement.pdf). We are the only two members on the team. Ryan and I decided how the various project roles would be divided amongst us. I will be responsible for scheduling, planning, and running meetings. Ryan will be largely responsible for the project budget and timeline. Many of the other tasks, including client communication, assembling the portfolio, and technical design will be shared. A more defined division of labor will develop as the semester progresses.

To do:
- [x] Pick a team name
- [x] Plan for first meeting
- [x] Write team contract
- [x] Decide on collaboration tools

I sent out a Doodle poll to find a time this week when Ankit, Taylor, and Dr. Robertson could meet with Ryan and I. In preparation for the meeting, I've come up with a list of questions/topics. 

- Full list of softwares, languages, packages, hardware, and programs that were used in the prototype
- Past documentation, schematics, code
- Problem statement, product requirements, specifications, and expected deliverables
- Who were all the past people involved in this project?
- What is the available budget?
- What is the imagined unit cost?
- What is a breakdown of the current unit cost?
- Who is the administrative assistant for our budget?
- Can we submit our budget early and order parts?
- What shop training will we need?
- What do we do about a client interview?

## Thursday, September 6th
Based on the results from the Doodle poll, the meeting will be this Friday from 11:30AM-12:30PM. I created the agenda, which can be found [here](https://github.com/kcaisley/CropTop/blob/master/Meetings/agenda-1.md).

Ryan and I have come up with the name *Team Crop Top*. We will check to make sure Dr. Robertson approves this Friday. The team contract has also been drafted and is stored on Ryan's OneDrive. For collaboration tools we will be using Slack for messaging, Doodle polls for meeting planning, and Google Docs and Microsoft OneDrive for file storage.

Our first team meeting went well. All were in attendance. The full meeting notes can be found [here](https://github.com/kcaisley/CropTop/blob/master/Meetings/notes-1.md), but the most important take-aways were:

- There are actually three seperate devices, which can potentially be integrated.
- The schematics, code, and documentation for the prototype have been shared with Ryan and I. I've made a copy of these [here](https://github.com/kcaisley/CropTop/tree/master/Documentation/Prototype).
- We are allowed to pick up a prototype device from Ankit's lab. This, in combination with the schematics, will greatly speed up our ability to create a single integrated PCB solution.
- Dr. Robertson has approved our name: *Team Crop Top*
- Unit cost is less of a priority than expected

From what I can tell, the device is organized somewhat like this:

Thinking back to the team meeting, it seems the order of priotiries are:
Project goals, in order of importance
1. Reduce production time
1. Improve reliability
1. Improve ease of use
1. Reduce unit cost
1. Improve device aesthetics

I have been thinking a lot about the GUI display, I posted on reddit.

The reddit post has blown up, the full post can be found [here](link), but the take aways are.

I attended a UI Library workshop today on Git. I have used Git before in the past, but never quite realized how useful it was as a collaboration tool. For documenting my end of the project, I have decided to port everything to github, for version control. I'm going to be keeping my personal logbook in a markdown file, which should make professional formatting intuitive.  

Ryan and I also picked up the prototype device and I started to pick it apart. Here is a picture of the current prototype.

I plan to do a more thorough breakdown of the device in the coming days, also looking through the
