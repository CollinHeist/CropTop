Ryan and I recieved our capstone project assignement today, entitled "*Product Design for Manufacture and Reliability*". Basic info on the project scope can be found [here](https://github.com/kcaisley/CropTop/blob/master/Documentation/project-statement.pdf). We are the only two members on the team. During the capstone class period, Ryan and I decided how the various project roles would be divided amongst us. I will be responsible for scheduling, planning, and running meetings. Ryan will be largely responsible for the project budget and timeline. Many of the other tasks, including all of the technical design work will be shared between us.

To do:
- [x] Decide on a team name
- [x] Plan for first meeting
