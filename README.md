Ryan and I recieved our capstone project assignment today, entitled "*Product Design for Manufacture and Reliability*". Basic info on the project scope can be found [here](https://github.com/kcaisley/CropTop/blob/master/Documentation/project-statement.pdf). We are the only two members on the team. Ryan and I decided how the various project roles would be divided amongst us. I will be responsible for scheduling, planning, and running meetings. Ryan will be largely responsible for the project budget and timeline. Many of the other tasks, including client communication, assembling the portfolio, and technical design will be shared. A more defined division of labor will develop as the semester progresses.

To do:
- [x] Pick a team name
- [x] Plan for first meeting
- [x] Write team contract
- [x] Decide on collaboration tools
