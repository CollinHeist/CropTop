SCHEMATIC:\n[Up to date]\n\nPCB:\nAll elements that have a pad, make sure that there is a pad pin and it's footprint is has the pad assigned to it\nCheck that all components with a pad are connected with solder paste in footprint\nAdd a cut out around temperature sensor (SHT35-D)\nAdd vias to mounting holes for style\nMake logo in copper layer, not silkscreen\nHow do I route a 90 ohm USB trace\nCopper pour on top layer\nPut croptop sign in copper layer\nMove ADC over star ground\nMove memory and ADC to different busses\nAdd heat sinks to motor drivers\nGround plane on top and bottom layer\nLook into thermal vias for motor drivers\nAdd silkscreen labels to configuration resistors\nWhen laying out the footprint for the motor drivers, follow datasheet\nMove micro usb and GPU connector further forward\nAdd ground plane to top and bottom layers\nStitch top and bottom layers together with vias\nSPI I2C and RS232 testpoints should be closer to pic, or at fork point\nLabel Terminal blocks on top side\nMake test points bigger {--> R y a n   t o l d   y o u   t o<--}\nAdd a via fence and copper perimeter to board edge\n\nCOMPLETION STEPS:\nManually check entire board with Ryan, with each datasheet\nCalculate power rail burdens\nFigure out if ESD diodes will mess up ADC measurements\nCome up with different devices configurations (using DNP for components)\nRun through pin out of every chip and verify it's connection\nVerify the package footprint of every chip\nMake sure that 3V3 rotary encoder buffer resistor is DNP\n
