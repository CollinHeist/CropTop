# StalkPusher

A device that aids crop plant breeders to more accurately predict plant strength

## Introduction

Yield losses in maize (Zea mays L.) due to stalk lodging has significant negative economic impact. The lodging resistance in maize could be advanced more rapidly with the development of selective breeding tools that accurately predict stalk strength. Motivated by the strong correlation between flexural stiffness and stalk strength as demonstrated by Robertson et al, the StalkPusher device aims to predict crop stalk strength by measuring the plant's flexural rigidity.
