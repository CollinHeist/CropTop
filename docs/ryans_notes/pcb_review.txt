Ryan Schematic Review:
Page 1 (Microcontroller):
-Combine power fault pins (active low) to one net?
-5V LED resistors limits to about 12mA, others are similiar, may need more current.
-LCD regulator, what about open circuit? Will this IC protect? Resistor will limit current to 185 mA, but max draw is 225mA?

Page 2(Display):
-looks good, I didn't spend much time on it
-maybe DNP the leds

Page 3 and 4(Peripherals):
-DC motor driver is limited to 1.06 A, was this intended?
-stepper motor cp cap is 0.1, datasheet calls for 0.01 at 50V rating
-stepper, calls for a different 3.3v cap (0.47u not .1) but probably okay
-stepper, isense is configured for 6A was this intended?
-I would remove all the LEDs that will work no matter what, we are talking about 5+ 10mA sinks running all the time
