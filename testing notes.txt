Tests:

Power supply:
- measure voltages and ripple for each supply
	- 5V USB input battery
	- 3v3 supply voltage and ripple
	- 5v5 charge pump output voltage and ripple
	- 5v LDO output voltage and ripple
	- LCD charge pump voltage and ripple

LCD:
- test responsiveness
- no aliasing during screen writes
	
Oscillator:
- verify the frequency of the waveform
	- if needed mess with SW driver strength
	- if needed choose new capacitors
- verify time drift, correct the drift using GPS reads
	
USB OTG:
- mass storage device
	- ensure the previous data won't be written over
	- write data of various size can be written
- HID
	- measure latency
	- ensure data is never missed

SPI:
- NAND Memory
	- ensure previous data won't be written over
	- when powered off, retain locations of crop data
	- recover from power off during operation
	- write data of various size can be written
- Load Cell and ADC
	- verify force data meets or exceed the previous device

Temp/humidity:
- create a calibration routine based on temperature curve
- verify that the temperature and humidity is sufficienty accurate
- test in a variety of temperatures and humidities

Accelerometer:
- test using a cell phone to compare the reading accuracy
- check the speed of measurements

GPS:
- Figure out if the protocol is just I2C
	- choose UART or I2C
- Verify connectivity is better than the previous device
- Verify accuracy and speed of locations

DC motor:
- measure current draw
- verify reverse polarity protection
- variable speed with OC

Rotary encoder:
- measure speed and verify accuracy and direction

Linear encoder:
- verify accuracy of linear position
- set up operation for the type of device (pusher or tipper)
