## General coding guidelines for our senior design

### File Header

All files will follow the following form:

/* **************************************************************************
 * File name:   SomeLib.c
 * Association: University of Idaho
 * Author:      
 * Dates:       Created x/x/xxxx
 * 
 * Summary:     Description of the file's purpose and functionality
 * 
 * Notes:       Optional, largely used during development to keep track of 
				work in progress.
 * **************************************************************************/
 

### Function Headers

TBD

 
### Comment Format

Strive to limit comments, if you can make a better funciton name or variable, do it.

//lower case touching forward slash
//opt for inline comments, avoid comments to the side of code


### Function Naming Convention

A library, such as MotorLib.c will have all functions labeled with "MotorLib_" before
a descriptive function name.
